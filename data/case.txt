3. Mr Shivendra Pratap Singh, ld. Counsel for the Appellant submits

that the impugned order merely rejects the application on the ground that it

is objectionable under Section 9/11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. However,

as per the Examination Report, there was only a relative ground of objection

under Section 11 and no objection was raised under Section 9.

4.

Ld. Counsel for the Appellant further submits that in the Examination

Report, objection was raised under Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999

that the applied trademark ‘SHALIMARK’ bears identity or similarity with

the earlier marks cited. The details of the said marks are as under:

(i)

‘SHALIMAR’ bearing no. 1015144 in class 19 in the name of

Shalimar Colours (India) Pvt. Ltd.

(ii)

‘SHALIMAR’ bearing no. 1321779 in class 19 in the name of

Mr. Sunil Kumar Agarwal

(iii)

‘SHALIMAR’ bearing no. 1729841 in class 19 in the name of

S. Raghbir Singh

5.

Insofar as the marks bearing no. 1321779 and 1729841 are concerned,

C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 161/2021

ld. Counsel for Appellant submits that they are abandoned.

6.

Ld. Counsel for the Appellant also brings to the notice of this Court

the substantial number of registrations with the prefix ‘SHALI’ which has

been registered in the name of the Appellant herein.

7.

The Court has heard ld. Counsels for the parties and perused the

record.

8.

A perusal of the impugned order would show that the order dated 31st

December, 2018 passed by the Hearing Officer (Senior Examiner of Trade

Marks) is completely cryptic and merely rejects the application on the

ground that it is objectionable under Section 9/11 of the Trade Marks Act,

1999.. The relevant part of the impugned order reads as under:

“* The trade mark applied for is objectionable under

Section 9/11 of the Act. The application is accordingly

refused.”

9.

A perusal of the record would show that the Appellant has more than

a hundred registrations for several marks with the ‘SHALI’ prefix such as

‘SHALI PLASTIC’, ‘SHALIGRIP’, ‘SHALIDECK’, etc. The word mark

‘SHALI’ is also registered in favour of the Appellant. The details of the

registrations which are granted in favour of the Appellant are placed on

record.

10.

The marks cited in the examination report bearing no. 1321779 and

1729841 have already been abandoned. The third cited mark bearing no.

1015144 is SHALIMAR of Shalimar Colours India Pvt. Ltd. which is in

respect of building material including cements, clinker, pipes (not of metal)

etc. On the other hand, the Appellant’s trade mark application is for the

mark SHALIMARK for building material (non-metallic); Resin based

C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 161/2021

thermoplastic road marking compound; water based road marking

compound.

11.

Since, building material is common to the cited mark bearing no.

1015144 and to the applied mark, ld. counsel for the Appellant submits that

he is willing to delete ‘building material (non-metallic)’ from the list of

goods.

12.

In view thereof, Appellant’s trade mark application bearing no.

2873856 for the mark ‘SHALIMARK’ shall be restricted to the following

goods:

Resin

based

thermoplastic

road marking

compound; water based road marking compound.

13. Accordingly, the Appellant’s application no. 2873856 shall proceed

for advertisement for the aforementioned goods in class 19 in the trade mark

journal. Let the same be advertised within three months.

14.

It is made clear that the present order would have no impact on

opposition proceedings, if any, which may be filed against the application.

15. Accordingly,

this appeal along with all pending applications is

allowed in the above terms.

16.

The Registry is directed to supply a copy of the present order to the

office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks of India

on the e-mail- llc-ipo@gov.in for compliance of this order.
