# JavaScript RAG Web App with LLamaIndex

üöÄ Excited to share my latest project: a JavaScript RAG web app leveraging the power of LLamaIndex! üåü

This app utilizes the RAG (Retrieve, Aggregate, Generate) technique to provide targeted insights for specific cases:

## How Does the RAG Technique Work?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Embed all your data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Embed your query.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve context that is nearby your query.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Feed that context and query to the LLamaIndex, and you get a reasonable answer to your query.

While it may be a small-scale project, it showcases the potential of RAG technology combined with LLamaIndex's capabilities! üí°‚ú®
